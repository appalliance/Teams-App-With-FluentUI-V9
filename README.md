# Apex Teams App

This will be the foundation for a teams app built in React using Microsoft's FluentUI v9 Components. 
It mimics the sample code from Microsoft's Visual Studio Teams Tool box but uses FluentUI v9 as opposed to Fluent Northstart.
It also addresses a vulnerability issue with xml2js by forcing all node modules to use the latest version of this library (0.5.0) 
as earlier versions had a critical vulnerability
